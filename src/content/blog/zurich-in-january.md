The light here is different.

I don't mean that in the way travel writers mean it — not the golden-hour, Instagram-filter kind of different. I mean the winter light in Zürich has a _weight_ to it. It comes through low, gray, and even. It flattens shadows. It makes the buildings along the Limmat look like they were drawn in graphite.

## The Fog

The Hochnebel — the high fog that settles over the Swiss Plateau from November through February — is the defining meteorological fact of life here. The mountains exist above it. The city exists below it. You live in a gray room with no ceiling.

People deal with this differently. Some take the train to the Üetliberg and stand above the cloud line, looking down at the hidden city. Some book flights to Lisbon. Some learn to love it.

I've started to love it.

## Time Moves Differently

There's something about the reduced light that compresses time. Days feel like they have one act instead of three. You wake in the dark, you work, the dark returns. The weekends are for walking — along the lake, through the old town, up the hills that ring the city.

The Swiss have a word for it, or rather, they have a practice: _Gemütlichkeit_ isn't quite right (that's German-German), but the idea of structured coziness, of intentional warmth against the cold — that's the Zürich winter.

## Why I Stay

People ask why I chose Zürich. The real answer is that Zürich chose a version of me I didn't know existed. The one who walks slowly. Who notices light. Who finds that constraint — geographic, climatic, cultural — is its own kind of freedom.
