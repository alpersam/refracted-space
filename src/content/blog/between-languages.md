I've been thinking about what language does to the self.

Not in the Sapir-Whorf, strong-hypothesis way — I don't think Turkish prevents me from understanding Swiss punctuality. But there's something real about the way you _become_ a slightly different person in each language you speak.

## The German Self

My German is functional. It gets me through the Gemeinde, the Migros, the morning Grüezi-chain with neighbours. But it's not the language I think in. It's not the language I feel in.

And yet — there's a precision in German that I've started to crave. The way compound nouns let you build meaning like Lego. _Weltanschauung_. _Feierabend_. _Sehnsucht_. English has to borrow these words because it can't build them.

## The Turkish Self

Turkish is the language of my inner monologue when I'm frustrated, amused, or homesick. It's the language of food, of family, of the self that existed before I learned to perform competence in other tongues.

There's a Turkish grammatical structure — the _miş_ past tense — that marks hearsay. You use it for things you didn't witness directly. _Gelmiş_ means "apparently he came." It bakes epistemic humility into the grammar itself.

English doesn't have this. English treats all statements as equally witnessed. I think that matters more than we admit.

## The Space Between

The interesting part isn't any single language. It's the _space between_ them. The moment where you reach for a word and three languages offer candidates, each carrying different emotional freight.

That space — that refraction — is where I actually live.
